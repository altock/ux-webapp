Create a usability test plan for validating a feature or flow.

## Instructions

1. **Define Objectives**
   - What decision will this test inform?
   - What hypotheses are we testing?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?

2. **Use Template Structure**
   - Follow `templates/USABILITY_TEST.md`
   - Design 3-6 realistic tasks
   - Define measurable success criteria

3. **Required Sections**
   - Overview (feature, test type, duration, participant count)
   - Research questions and hypotheses
   - Participant recruiting criteria
   - Setup checklist (environment, recording, materials)
   - Introduction script
   - Task scenarios with success criteria
   - Post-task rating questions
   - Debrief questions
   - Metrics (quantitative and qualitative)
   - Analysis framework

4. **Task Quality**
   - Scenarios must be realistic, not leading
   - Success criteria must be observable
   - Follow-up questions should probe understanding, not satisfaction

Reference `reference/HEURISTICS.md` for evaluation criteria.
